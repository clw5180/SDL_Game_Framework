SDL 2.0 Textures
3/18/2014

Wraps SDL Textures into a more streamlined Texture class for easy loading and rendering. Also includes TextureBank class for loading multiple textures at once, and a FileManager class for reading directories (with iOS support).

Build requirements
 - SDL 2.0 (http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
 - SDL Image 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)

Notes:
 - You probably want to use and build against 32-bit build of SDL
 - These project files assume SDL and SDL_image are located inside of "SDL2" folder and part of your search paths (SDL2/SDL.h)
 - Build files using a compatible c++11 compiler
